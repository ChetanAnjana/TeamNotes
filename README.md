# Voice Input Web Application: TeamNotes

This project allows users to input voice commands and process them accordingly. It was initially hosted and used by a group of people, to take and share their notes with each other during class. However, after free hostings were disabled I changed it to work locally on your computer. There's still a MongoDB database connected to its backend and this guide will help you set it up on your machine.
